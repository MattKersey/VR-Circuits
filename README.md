## Setup
**Please read this as it is absolutely necessary for running the project**  
In order to deploy, you will need to build the project in Unity and deploy it to an Oculus Quest. Before doing this, you need to set up EchoAR to support the project. All necessary files are located in Assets/Models/. You will need to upload all .glb files as well as the associated metadata in the .csv files. From here, all you will need to do is add your API Key into the EchoAR game object in the main scene (Scenes/VR Circuits).
